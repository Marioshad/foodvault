- üì∑ AI-powered receipt scanning and processing
- üìä Advanced analytics and reporting
- üè∑Ô∏è Smart expiration date management
- üì± Responsive design for all devices

## Tech Stack

- React.js frontend with TypeScript
- Node.js backend
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API for receipt processing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Authentication with Passport.js
- Deployed on Railway

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenAI API key
- Git installed

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/food-inventory-app.git
cd food-inventory-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/food_inventory
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_session_secret
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deploying to Railway

### 1. Initial Setup

1. Create a Railway account at [railway.app](https://railway.app) and connect it with your GitHub account
2. Fork this repository or push your local repository to GitHub:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/food-inventory-app.git
git push -u origin main
```
3. In Railway, create a new project and select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository

### 2. Database Setup

1. In your Railway project, click "New Service" and select "Database"
2. Choose "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically create a new PostgreSQL database and provide the connection URL
4. The `DATABASE_URL` will be automatically added to your environment variables
5. The application uses Drizzle ORM which will automatically create the database schema on first deployment

### 3. Environment Variables

In your Railway project, go to the "Variables" tab and add the following:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `SESSION_SECRET`: A random string for session encryption
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"

The `DATABASE_URL` will be automatically set by Railway when you created the database.

### 4. Deployment

1. Railway will automatically detect your Node.js application
2. The deployment will start automatically when you push changes to your GitHub repository
3. Railway will use the scripts defined in `package.json` to build and start your application
4. Once deployed, you can access your application via the URL provided by Railway

### 5. Database Migrations

The application uses Drizzle ORM for database management. Railway will automatically run the database migrations during deployment using the `npm run db:push` command specified in the build script.

## Environment Variables Reference

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI services
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret key for session management
- `NODE_ENV`: Application environment (development/production)

## Troubleshooting

1. If the deployment fails, check the build logs in Railway
2. Ensure all environment variables are properly set
3. Check if the database connection is working
4. Verify that the OpenAI API key is valid and has proper permissions

## Development Guidelines

1. Always run database migrations when making schema changes
2. Test the receipt scanning feature with various receipt formats
3. Ensure proper error handling for API requests
4. Follow the existing code style and formatting
