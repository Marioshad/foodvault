Project Proposal: Food Reserve Tracking App

1. Project Overview

This project aims to develop a cross-platform application (web, Android, and iOS) to help users efficiently track their food reserves across multiple storage locations such as home, office, or a country house. The goal is to minimize manual input while maximizing automation, ensuring users can easily monitor expiration dates, shopping history, and spending trends.

2. Core Features

2.1 Food Inventory Management

Categorization of food items by storage location (Fridge, Pantry, Storage, etc.).

Ability to track items in multiple locations (Home, Office, Country House, etc.).

Search and filter functionality by name, category, or expiration date.

2.2 Expiration Date Tracking (Minimal User Input)

Automated Expiry Tracking:

Leverage barcode scanning and online databases to auto-fetch expiration dates.

AI-based expiration estimation for fresh produce (e.g., shelf-life recommendations based on purchase date).

Optional manual input for custom items.

Notifications & Alerts:

Users receive alerts for soon-to-expire items.

Suggested recipes using near-expiry ingredients.

2.3 Shopping & Cost Tracking

Purchase Tracking:

Record where an item was purchased (store selection via dropdown or auto-location tagging).

Allow input of price per unit (per item, per kg, per liter, etc.).

Budget Insights:

Track spending habits with analytics on food costs over time.

Visual representation of expenditure by category or location.

2.4 Multi-Device Sync & Collaboration

Real-time sync across devices (web, Android, iOS).

Shared access for family members, roommates, or office teams.

3. Technical Implementation

3.1 Tech Stack

Frontend:

Web: React.js (Next.js for server-side rendering for performance optimization)

Mobile: React Native (shared codebase for Android & iOS)

Backend:

Node.js with Express.js (scalable API architecture)

PostgreSQL or MongoDB (structured or semi-structured food data storage)

Firebase for real-time updates and push notifications

Image Recognition & Barcode Scanning:

Integration with Open Food Facts API or other food databases for barcode scanning.

OCR and AI-powered image recognition for receipts or product labels.

3.2 Minimal Input Strategy

Barcode scanning for auto-filling product details.

Smart categorization based on common grocery items.

AI-driven best-before date estimation for items without barcodes.

Voice input support for faster entry.

3.3 Security & User Data Privacy

Secure user authentication (OAuth, Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In).

Encrypted cloud storage with optional local storage mode.

Role-based access for shared inventories.

4. Development Roadmap

Phase 1: MVP Development (3-4 Months)

Core Inventory Management (Add, Edit, Remove items, Locations, and Categories).

Barcode Scanning & Expiration Tracking (Basic Automation Features).

Shopping Tracking & Price Entry.

Multi-device sync and collaborative sharing.

Phase 2: AI & Automation Enhancements (2-3 Months)

AI-powered expiration predictions.

Image recognition for non-barcoded items.

Budget analytics & reporting.

Smart recipe suggestions for near-expiry products.

Phase 3: UX & Scaling (2-3 Months)

Enhanced UI/UX improvements.

Optimization for large inventories.

Multi-language support.

Beta testing & deployment.

5. Conclusion

This application will offer a seamless and efficient solution for users to manage their food supplies while reducing waste and saving money. By incorporating barcode scanning, AI-based expiration predictions, and minimal user input strategies, the app will be both intuitive and powerful. With the outlined roadmap, the development team can iteratively build and refine the product, ensuring a robust and scalable system.

Next Steps:

Gather input from the development team on feasibility and tech stack alignment.

Identify key API providers for food databases, barcode scanning, and AI functionalities.

Plan a prototype development cycle for rapid testing and validation.
