You're getting the 404 error ("The model gpt-4-turbo does not exist or you do not have access to it.") because of one of the following reasons:

Possible Causes and Fixes
1. Incorrect Model Name
Ensure you're using the correct model name when making an API request. The available models for image recognition are:

For text-only tasks: gpt-4-turbo
For image-related tasks: gpt-4-turbo-vision
âœ… Fix:
If you're trying to use OpenAI's vision model, update your request to use:

json
Copy
Edit
"model": "gpt-4-turbo-vision"
2. Lack of Access to Vision Models
Not all OpenAI accounts have access to vision models by default.

âœ… Fix:

Check your OpenAI API Key and usage settings.
If you donâ€™t see access to gpt-4-turbo-vision, you might need to request access or upgrade your plan.
3. Outdated API Version
If you're using an old API version, OpenAI might not recognize the new model names.

âœ… Fix:

Make sure youâ€™re using the latest API version:
json
Copy
Edit
"api_version": "v1"
Update your OpenAI SDK or client library if needed.
4. Incorrect API Endpoint
Ensure you're making a request to the correct endpoint. For OpenAIâ€™s API, it should be:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
âœ… Fix:

If using an SDK like openai in Python, ensure you're making the correct request:
python
Copy
Edit
import openai

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-vision",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Describe this image"}],
    api_key="your-api-key"
)
5. Account Billing or API Key Issue
If your billing is inactive or your API key is invalid, OpenAI will reject your request.

âœ… Fix:

Verify your API key at OpenAI API keys page.
Ensure your billing is active: OpenAI Billing.
Final Steps to Debug
Check if your OpenAI account has access to gpt-4-turbo-vision.
Ensure youâ€™re using "model": "gpt-4-turbo-vision".
Use the correct API endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions.
Confirm that your API key and billing are active.
Update your API version if necessary.
